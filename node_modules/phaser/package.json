It uses a custom build of [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and desktop apps via 3rd party tools like Cocoon, Cordova and Electron.\n\nAlong with the fantastic open source community Phaser is actively developed and maintained by [Photon Storm Limited](http://www.photonstorm.com). As a result of rapid support and a developer friendly API Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.\n\nThousands of developers worldwide use it. From indies and multi-national digital agencies to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible games. Grab the source and join in the fun!\n\n* **Visit:** The [Phaser website](http://phaser.io) and follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) (#phaserjs)\n* **Learn:** [API Documentation](http://phaser.io/docs), [Support Forum][forum] and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phaser-framework)\n* **Code:** 700+ [Source Examples](http://phaser.io/examples) (also available in this [git repo][examples])\n* **Read:** Subscribe to the weekly [Phaser World Newsletter](http://phaser.io/community/newsletter)\n* **Chat:** [#phaserio IRC channel](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/4470-official-phaserio-irc-channel-phaserio-on-freenode/) or our [Slack Channel](http://phaser.io/news/2015/08/phaser-slack-channel)\n* **Extend:** With [Phaser Plugins](http://phaser.io/shop/plugins)\n* **Be awesome:** Support the future of Phaser on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm) or by buying our [books](http://phaser.io/shop/books)\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n## Index\n\n- [What's New?](#whats-new)\n- [Support Phaser](#patreon)\n- [Phaser World](#phaserworld)\n- [Download Phaser](#download)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Using Phaser](#using-phaser)\n- [Games made with Phaser](#games)\n- [Requirements](#requirements)\n- [Road Map](#road-map)\n- [Change Log](#change-log)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"whats-new\"></a>\n## What's new in Phaser 2.4.7\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://phaser.io/images/github/news.jpg\"></div>\n\n> TBA\n\nPhaser 2.4.7 is our second release in 2016 and represents several months of fixes and optimizations. As a point release it's a safe update from a previous 2.4 build, but as always please test first before upgrading, and be sure to skim through the extensive change log. There are some great new features including Dolby Digital sound support, loads of updates to Pixi and a new Webpack bundle.\n\nDue to on-going development of Lazer (previously known as Phaser 3) Phaser is soon to enter the LTS (long-term support) stage of its life. This is when we impose a feature freeze, locking the API down and responding only to bugs. This is a necessary step to allow us to focus on Lazer while still ensuring Phaser is given the support it deserves. Thousands of developers use Phaser and we've no intention of ignoring that. However with the release of 2.4.5 we will now be moderating issues opened on GitHub to this effect.\n\nAs always, keep you eyes on the Phaser web site or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) for the latest news.\n\nFinally we'd be extremely grateful if you could get involved with our [Phaser Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm). The uptake so far has been fantastic. Thank you to everyone who now supports Phaser development and shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming and Phasers role in that.\n\nHappy coding everyone! See you on the forums.\n\nCheers,\n\nRich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)\n\n![boogie](http://www.phaser.io/images/spacedancer.gif)\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"patreon\"></a>\n## Support Phaser on Patreon\n\n![patreon](http://www.phaser.io/images/patreon.png)\n\nPlease help support the future development of Phaser / Lazer through our [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm). We've some exciting plans and there's so much we'd like to do.\n\n### Phaser Sponsors\n\nPhaser is [sponsored](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm) by the following great companies:\n\n![qici](http://www.phaser.io/images/sponsors/qici-100.png)\n\nQICI Engine: [A powerful one-stop integrated Phaser game editor](http://www.qiciengine.com/)\n\n![zenva](http://www.phaser.io/images/sponsors/zenva-100.png)\n\nZenva Academy: [Online courses on Phaser, HTML5 and native app development](https://academy.zenva.com/?zva_src=phaserpatreon)\n\n![abra](http://www.phaser.io/images/sponsors/abra-100.png)\n\nAbra: [Complete browser based game development](https://aurifexlabs.com/)\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"phaserworld\"></a>\n## Phaser World\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://phaser.io/images/github/phaser-world.png\"></div>\n\n[Phaser World](http://phaser.io/community/newsletter) is our free weekly newsletter published every Friday.

From setting up a web server, to picking an IDE and coding your first game. Please start here no matter what your game-dev experience, before diving in to the API.\n\nThe single biggest Phaser resource is the [Phaser web site](http://phaser.io/news). It has hundreds of tutorials listed and fresh ones are added every week. Keep coming back to see what's new!\n\nUsing Phaser with **TypeScript**? Check out this great series of [Game From Scratch](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Adventures-in-Phaser-with-TypeScript-tutorial-series.aspx) tutorials.\n\nPrefer **videos** to reading? Lynda.com have published a video based course: [HTML5 Game Development with Phaser](http://www.lynda.com/Phaser-tutorials/HTML5-Game-Development-Phaser/163641-2.html) (requires subscription)\n\n### Source Code Examples\n\nEver since we started Phaser we've been growing and expanding our extensive set of source code examples. Currently there are over 700 of them!\n\nBrowse the [Phaser Examples](http://phaser.io/examples) or clone the [examples repo][examples] and eat your heart out!\n\n### Interphase\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://phaser.io/content/interphase/1/images/editorial/pages.jpg\"></div>\n\n[Interphase](http://phaser.io/interphase) is a new book for Phaser developers of all skill levels.\n\nWith 400 pages of content you'll find detailed articles, game development \"Making Of\" guides and tutorials. All were written using the latest version of Phaser, so you won't be learning any out-dated tricks here.\n\nAs well as the book you get all the source code, graphics and assets to go with it, and lots of extras too.\n\n[Read More](http://phaser.io/interphase)\n\n### Game Mechanic Explorer\n\nThe [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com) is a great interactive way to learn how to develop specific game mechanics in Phaser. Well worth exploring once you've got your dev environment set-up.\n\n### Mighty Editor - Visual Game Editor\n\n[MightyEditor](http://mightyfingers.com/) is a browser-based visual Phaser game editor. Create your maps with ease, position objects and share them in seconds. It also exports to native Phaser code. Excellent for quickly setting-up levels and scenes.\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"using-phaser\"></a>\n## Using Phaser\n\nPhaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development and the minified version for production.\n\n### Custom Builds\n\nPhaser includes a grunt based build system which allows you to strip out lots of additional features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then you can now exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be stripped out too.\n\nAs a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 80KB minified and gzipped.\n\nSee the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.\n\n### Webpack\n\nStarting from Phaser 2.4.5 we now include a custom build for Webpack.\n\nYou need to add `p2` as a dependency.\n\n##### Webpack Config\n\n```\nvar path = require('path');\nvar webpack = require('webpack');\n\nvar phaserModule = path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/phaser/');\nvar phaser = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/phaser-split.js'),\n  pixi = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/pixi.js'),\n  p2 = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/p2.js');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    ...\n    module: {\n        loaders: [\n            { test: /pixi.js/, loader: \"script\" },\n        ]\n    },\n    resolve: {\n        alias: {\n            'phaser': phaser,\n            'pixi.js': pixi,\n            'p2': p2,\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n##### Main js file\n\n```\nrequire('pixi.js');\nrequire('p2');\nrequire('phaser');\n```\n\n### Building from source\n\nShould you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.\n\nRun `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"games\"></a>\n## Games made with Phaser\n\nThousands of games have been made in Phaser. From game jam entries to titles by some of the largest entertainment brands in the world. Here is a tiny sample:\n\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/bubble-academy.png)][game10]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/woodventure.png)][game11]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/hopsop.png)][game12]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/banana-mania.png)][game13]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/salazar.png)][game14]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/phaser-shmup.png)][game15]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/trappy-trap.png)][game16]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/runaway-ruins.png)][game17]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/ananias.png)][game18]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot1a.jpg)][game1]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot2a.jpg)][game2]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot3a.jpg)][game3]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot4a.jpg)][game4]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot5b.jpg)][game5]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot6b.jpg)][game6]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot7b.jpg)][game7]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot8.jpg)][game8]\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot9.jpg)][game9]\n\nArtwork copyright their respective owners.\n\nWe add [new games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) to the Phaser site weekly, so be sure to send us yours when it's finished!\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"requirements\"></a>\n## Requirements\n\nPhaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.\n\nWhile Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with regard to memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.\n\n### IE9\n\nIf you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x **and** use P2 physics then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.\n\n### JavaScript and TypeScript\n\nPhaser is developed in JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't *force* you to. It's your choice.\n\nIf you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"road-map\"></a>\n## Road Map\n\nThe majority of Phaser development is now taking place on the Lazer (Phaser 3) project. The Phaser 2 branch will still be supported and issues fixed, but roadmap features have been migrated over.\n\n<a name=\"phaser3\"></a>\n## Lazer (Phaser 3)\n\nLazer is the new name for Phaser 3.\n\nLazer is the next generation of the Phaser game framework. Using a completely ES6 base it is renderer agnostic, allowing for DOM, SVG, Canvas and WebGL rendering, across desktop and mobile web browsers.\n\nYou can read all about the philosophy behind Lazer [here](http://phaser.io/news/2016/01/phaser-in-2015-and-beyond) or join the Google Groups [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phaser3-dev) where progress reports are posted on a regular basis.\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"change-log\"></a>\n## Change Log\n\n## Version 2.4.7 - \"Hinderstap\" - In Development\n\n### New Features\n\n* Added P2.Body.thrustLeft which will move the Body to the left by the speed given (thanks James Pryor)\n* Added P2.Body.thrustRight which will move the Body to the right by the speed given (thanks James Pryor)\n* Polygon now takes an array of arrays as a new type when constructing it: `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2]]` (thanks @ShimShamSam #2360)\n\n### Updates\n\n* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks @clark-stevenson)\n* Docs typo fixes (thanks)\n* Removed a console.log from the TilingSprite generator.\n* Sound.position can no longer become negative, meaning calls to AudioContextNode.start with negative position offsets will no longer throw errors (thanks @Weedshaker #2351)\n* The default state of the internal property `_boundDispatch` in Phaser.Signal is now `false`, which allows for use of boundDispatches (thanks @alvinlao #2346)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* The `mouseoutglobal` event listener wasn't removed when the game was destroyed (thanks @stoneman1 #2345 #2344 #2342)\n* Fixed issue with IE crashing on this.context.close in the Sound Manager (thanks @stoneman1 #2349)\n* Phaser.World.centerX and Phaser.World.centerY only worked if the bounds had an origin of 0, 0. They now take into account the actual origin (thanks @fillmoreb #2353)\n* SoundManager.destroy now validates that context.close is a valid function before calling it (thanks @brianbunch #2355)\n* SoundManager.destroy doesn't close the context if it's being stored in PhaserGlobal (thanks @brianbunch #2356)\n\n### Pixi Updates\n\nPlease note that Phaser uses a custom build of Pixi and always has done. The following changes have been made to our custom build, not to Pixi in general.\n\n* DisplayObjectContainer.getLocalBounds destroys the worldTransforms on children until the next `stage.updateTransform()` call. This can make a number of things break including mouse input if width, height or getLocalBounds methods are called inside of an update or preUpdate method. This is now fixed in our Pixi build (thanks @st0nerhat #2357)\n\nFor changes in previous releases please see the extensive [Version History](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\n\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [Contributors Guide][contribute] for full details on helping with Phaser, but the main points are:\n\n- Found a bug? Report it on [GitHub Issues][issues] and include a code sample.\n\n- Pull Requests should only be made against the `dev` branch. *Never* against `master`.\n\n- Before submitting a Pull Request run your code through [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) using our [config](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/.jshintrc).\n\n- Before contributing please read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nWritten something cool that shows Phaser in use?
